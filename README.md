# GoSeiGEN - LLM Go Engine

GoSeiGEN is a Go AI engine which implements the AlphaGo Zero paper in "Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge" and a LLM that can explain why a move was played, in human understandable terms. 

In 2016, Alpha Go opened a whole new era to the game of Go, where all of the principles of the game had been reintroduced and replaced by AI. Since then the battle between human and computer is over and the strongest engines are too strong to leave any world champion any hope for a win. Continued development on hardware and software has made AI engines unbeatable for humans but less progress has been made in transfering this superior playing skills to human players.

Of course, AI plays Go in a different way, but why are they not able to communicate more about a position than just the evaluation: a single numeric value.

Hence the goal of this project to add human Cognitive skills to Go AI engines: Develop programs that help human players improve their skills, that can communicate in human understandable terms about Go.
